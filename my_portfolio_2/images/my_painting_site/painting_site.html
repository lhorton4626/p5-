<h1>My Painting Site
</h1>
<p>My name is Lilly Horton and I am a senior in high school. One of my favorite things to do in my free time is to paint. I am not a professional artist by any means, but I just really enjoy painting for fun. Painting completely relaxes me and it is so cool to start with one color and build it into a picture. This is a Webpage dedicated to my favorite paintings. </p>
	<h2>My Favorite Artist
</h2>
<p>My favorite arist has always been Bob Ross. He has several seasons of him painting on youtube that can help teach you how to paint. He is my favorite because of how simple he makes the process of painting. His videos are also very soothing and allow you to relax. Bob Ross mostly paints landscapes, which is my personal favorite thing to paint. If you are a new artist or just like to paint for fun like me, I highly suggest checking out some of his videos!</p>
<h4>A Few Bob Ross Favorites</h4>
	 <ul>
		 <li><em>On a Clear Day</em></li>
    	 <li><em>Bubbling Stream</em></li>
		 <li><em>Forest River</em></li>
  </ul>
<blockquote><p><em>&quot;“We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.”
